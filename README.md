# Bookly Web App

Bookly is a web application to help people borrow books inside trusted communities.
It is my final project for CS50w course. 

Bookly is a web application to help people borrow books inside trusted communities.
It may facilitate physical book exchange between users of the same 
social group, like a school, college, neighbourhood and alike. The users can manage 
their personal collections, stablish specific term for lending and explore the books 
they may like in a given community. Also, the system implements a trust mechnism by 
which a person can be considered trusted by it's peers.
